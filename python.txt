DEFINITION OF PYTHON:

        Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Python is an interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
        Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a large and comprehensive standard library.Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. Python, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. Python is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.
